# Vite Typescript + Tailwind Starter

Simple, opinionated, **fully typed**, and **production-ready** project template for Vite.

![Editor screenshot](src/assets/editor_screenshot.png)

This template is **practical** and **batteries included** but not overly complex or bloated. Also explicit configuration over magic; it should be easy to understand how everything works, strip out anything you don't need, and fast to modify things to your needs.

Includes **plenty of examples** of how to do things but **minimal cruft** to delete to get you going.

A [detailed changelog](./CHANGES.md) is available.

- Using newest `script setup` syntax w/ Ref sugar (see the official [Script Setup documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html) and [Ref Sugar RFC](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions/369) discussion)

## Notes


- In order to take full advance of the new `script setup` sugar and full TypeScript support in Vue SFC templates (like in the screenshot above), you should disable Vetur and use [Volar](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar) instead. (This is totally optional but recommended as it results much better DX!) See [official IDE Support documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-tooling.html#ide-support).
- If you need more than one parameter in the typed Vuex actions, use `payload` object instead of multiple parameters. For example: 
  ```typescript
  [Action.updateItem](
    { commit }: AugmentedActionContext,
    payload: {
      id: string
      obj: Partial<MyItem>
    }
  ): Promise<void>
  ```
